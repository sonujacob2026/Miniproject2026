# Admin User Management Guide

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices Implemented**

### **What Admins CAN Do:**
✅ **Enable/Disable Users** - Suspend or reactivate user accounts  
✅ **View All User Data** - Access user profiles and information  
✅ **Filter Users** - Filter by status (Active, Suspended, Pending, Admin)  
✅ **Search Users** - Find users by name or email  

### **What Admins CANNOT Do:**
❌ **Edit User Information** - Display names, emails, phone numbers are read-only  
❌ **Delete Users** - Users are disabled/suspended instead of deleted  
❌ **Change Passwords** - Users must reset their own passwords  

## 🎯 **User Status System**

### **Status Types:**
- **Active** (Green) - User can log in and use the system
- **Suspended** (Red) - User account is disabled, cannot log in
- **Pending** (Blue) - User account is awaiting approval/verification

### **Status Management:**
- **Disable User**: Changes status from Active → Suspended
- **Enable User**: Changes status from Suspended → Active
- **Edit Status**: Manually set any status via Edit modal

## 🔧 **Admin Actions**

### **Disable/Enable User:**
1. Click "Disable" to suspend a user (Active → Suspended)
2. Click "Enable" to reactivate a user (Suspended → Active)
3. Confirmation dialog prevents accidental changes
4. Button color changes based on current status:
   - **Red button** for active users (to disable)
   - **Green button** for suspended users (to enable)

### **Filter Users:**
- **All Users** - Show everyone
- **Active Users** - Show only active accounts
- **Suspended Users** - Show only disabled accounts
- **Pending Users** - Show only pending accounts
- **Admin Users** - Show only admin accounts

## 🛡️ **Security Features**

### **Email Protection:**
- Emails cannot be edited by admins
- Prevents authentication issues
- Maintains user identity integrity

### **Soft Delete:**
- Users are suspended, not deleted
- Preserves data integrity
- Allows account recovery

### **Status-Based Access:**
- Suspended users cannot log in
- Pending users may have limited access
- Active users have full access

## 📊 **User Information Displayed**

### **Table Columns:**
- **USER** - Avatar, name, and user ID
- **EMAIL** - User's email address (read-only)
- **STATUS** - Current account status with color coding
- **LAST SIGN IN** - When user last accessed the system
- **JOINED** - When user account was created
- **STATUS CONTROL** - Single Enable/Disable button

### **Admin Badge:**
- Admin users show an additional "Admin" badge
- Helps identify administrative accounts
- Cannot be removed by regular admins

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **Email Changes**: Users must change their own emails through their profile settings
2. **Password Resets**: Users must reset their own passwords via "Forgot Password"
3. **Data Preservation**: Suspending users preserves all their data
4. **Audit Trail**: All admin actions should be logged (future enhancement)

## 🔄 **Workflow Examples**

### **Suspending a Problematic User:**
1. Find user in the table
2. Click "Disable" button
3. Confirm the action
4. User status changes to "Suspended"
5. User cannot log in until re-enabled

### **Reactivating a User:**
1. Filter by "Suspended Users"
2. Find the user
3. Click "Enable" button

### **Viewing User Information:**
1. All user information is displayed in the table
2. User details are read-only for security
3. Only status can be changed via Enable/Disable
4. Changes are reflected immediately

This system provides secure, controlled user management while maintaining data integrity and user privacy.

## **Quick Test Steps**

### **1. Database Setup (Required First)**
Before testing, you need to run these SQL scripts in Supabase:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**
2. **Run `INCOME_TABLE_SCHEMA.sql`** - Creates the income_records table
3. **Run `RECEIPTS_STORAGE_SETUP.sql`** - Creates storage bucket for receipts

### **2. Test the Basic Form**
1. **Start the development server**: `npm run dev`
2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:5173`
3. **Login to your account**
4. **Click "Add Income" button** in the dashboard
5. **Fill out the form**:
   - Amount: `50000` (or any positive number)
   - Source: `Property Sale` (or any text)
   - Date: Today's date (or any date)
   - Payment Method: Select any method
   - Description: Optional text
   - Receipt: Upload PNG, JPEG, or PDF file (optional)

‚úÖ **PDF files** should upload but show "OCR not available" message
‚úÖ **Success message** should appear after submission
‚úÖ **Form should reset** after successful submission
‚úÖ **Modal should close** automatically after 2 seconds

### **4. Database Verification**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Table Editor**
2. **Select `income_records` table**
3. **Verify your record appears** with correct data
4. **Check that `user_id` matches your account**

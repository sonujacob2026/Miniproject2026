# Receipt Upload Feature Documentation

## Overview
The Receipt Upload feature allows users to upload receipt images and automatically extract expense information using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology powered by Tesseract.js.

## Features

### 1. File Upload
- **Drag & Drop**: Users can drag and drop receipt images onto the upload area
- **Click to Upload**: Users can click the upload area to select files
- **File Validation**: Supports PNG, JPG, JPEG files up to 10MB
- **Preview**: Shows a preview of the uploaded receipt image

### 2. OCR Text Extraction
- **Tesseract.js Integration**: Uses Tesseract.js for text extraction from images
- **Progress Indicators**: Shows upload and processing progress
- **Error Handling**: Displays helpful error messages for failed operations

### 3. Automatic Field Population
The system automatically extracts and populates the following fields:

#### Amount Detection
- Recognizes currency symbols: â‚¹, Rs.
- Extracts decimal amounts (e.g., 150.00, 1,250.50)
- Handles various number formats

#### Date Detection
- Supports multiple date formats:
  - DD-MM-YYYY (e.g., 15-03-2024)
  - DD/MM/YYYY (e.g., 15/03/2024)
  - Handles 2-digit years (converts to 20XX)
- Converts to YYYY-MM-DD format for database storage

#### Payment Method Detection
- **UPI**: Detects keywords like "upi", "gpay", "phonepe", "paytm", "bharatpe"
- **Card**: Detects "card", "debit", "credit", "visa", "mastercard"
- **Cash**: Detects "cash", "currency"
- **Net Banking**: Detects "net banking", "online", "internet banking"

#### UPI ID Detection
- Recognizes UPI ID patterns: `user@bank` format
- Automatically sets payment method to "UPI" when UPI ID is detected
- Examples: `username@okaxis`, `mobile@upi`

#### Description Extraction
- Extracts the first line of text as description
- Limits to 100 characters for database storage

### 4. User Experience
- **Auto-fill with Confirmation**: Extracted data is populated in form fields for user review
- **Editable Fields**: Users can modify any auto-filled information before saving
- **Success Notifications**: Shows confirmation when receipt is processed successfully
- **Loading States**: Displays progress bars and spinners during processing

### 5. Storage Integration
- **Supabase Storage**: Receipts are stored in Supabase Storage bucket named "receipts"
- **Public URLs**: Generates public URLs for uploaded receipts
- **Database Integration**: Stores receipt URLs in the `receipt_url` column of expenses/transactions tables

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- **ReceiptUpload.jsx**: Main component handling file upload, OCR processing, and data extraction
- **Integration**: Added to SimpleAddExpenseModal, ExpenseForm, and HouseholdExpenseForm

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Added to both expenses and transactions tables
ALTER TABLE expenses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS receipt_url TEXT;
ALTER TABLE transactions ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS receipt_url TEXT;
```

### Dependencies
- **tesseract.js**: ^6.0.1 (already installed)
- **@supabase/supabase-js**: For storage operations

## Usage

### For Users
1. Open any expense form (Add Expense, Household Expense, etc.)
2. Scroll to the "Upload Receipt" section
3. Either drag and drop a receipt image or click to select a file
4. Wait for OCR processing to complete
5. Review the auto-filled information
6. Edit any incorrect fields as needed
7. Submit the expense as usual

### For Developers
The ReceiptUpload component accepts these props:
- `onDataExtracted`: Callback function called when OCR data is extracted
- `onReceiptUploaded`: Callback function called when receipt is uploaded to storage
- `disabled`: Boolean to disable the upload functionality

## Error Handling

### File Validation Errors
- Invalid file type (not an image)
- File size exceeds 10MB limit
- Network errors during upload

### OCR Processing Errors
- Failed to extract text from image
- Corrupted or unreadable image files
- Network timeouts during processing

### Storage Errors
- Supabase Storage bucket not configured
- Permission issues
- Storage quota exceeded

## Performance Considerations

### File Size Limits
- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Recommended image resolution: 300-600 DPI for better OCR accuracy

### Processing Time
- OCR processing typically takes 2-5 seconds depending on image complexity
- Progress indicators provide user feedback during processing

### Browser Compatibility
- Requires modern browsers with File API support
- Tesseract.js works in all major browsers

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multi-language Support**: Add support for regional languages
2. **Receipt Templates**: Recognize specific merchant receipt formats
3. **Batch Processing**: Upload multiple receipts at once
4. **Receipt Categories**: Auto-categorize based on merchant information
5. **Expense Validation**: Cross-reference extracted data with bank statements

### Advanced OCR Features
1. **Table Detection**: Extract tabular data from receipts
2. **Merchant Recognition**: Identify specific stores and services
3. **Tax Calculation**: Extract tax amounts separately
4. **Item-level Details**: Extract individual line items from receipts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **OCR Not Working**: Ensure image is clear and text is readable
2. **Upload Fails**: Check file size and format requirements
3. **Storage Errors**: Verify Supabase Storage bucket configuration
4. **Slow Processing**: Large images may take longer to process

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify Supabase Storage bucket permissions
- Ensure Tesseract.js is properly loaded
